# college-sports-radio-postgame-show-generator
This is the repository for my final project for the "Generative AI" class at the University of Chicago. The goal is to create a workflow for langchain agents to generate content, similar to how a sports radio show works with callers and advertisements.

The Colab Notebook is stored as "PostGameRadioShow-CollegeSports-Generator.ipynb" and shows the code I used to generate the postgame audio. I have created a demo that goes over every part of the project including a full beginning to end run of the "pipeline" from creation to generation. I would advise you to watch the demo firts as it is pretty comprehensive and will allow you to know what parts of the code to look at. You can view the demo using this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/104Y32GC8RRlZn4YSGgB5YLlm88O9Bm9P/view?usp=drive_link

The final postgame "audio" generated is stored in this repo as "postgame-show-louisville-stanford (1).mp3".
