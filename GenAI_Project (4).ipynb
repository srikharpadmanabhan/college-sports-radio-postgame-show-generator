This is a radio broadcast about the following game of college {sport}: \\\"{input_game}\\\". Host 1 should start the broadcast and discuss the main points about the game first, so that the callers and other host know what to respond to. It can be especially useful to use tools like TavilySearch at the start. The main part of the broadcast will be conversation between host 1 and host 2. Please make up some names for each host but keep these consistent from the start. IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU MUST END THE BROADCAST AS HOST 1 using the messaging described as soon as the broadcast has gone on too long. Please do not have more than {max_length} messages). Your broadcast should take a few callers, time permitting, but mainly you should have a good back and forth between Host 1 and Host 2. Advertisements can come in every now and then, but make sure there is enough content between these ad breaks. Also make sure you introduce each caller before they talk. In this case, you must include the phrase \\\"Let's hear from\\\", somewhere in this introduction. Again, please do not make this a lengthy broadcast (some callers and maybe a few ad breaks if needed and wrap it up (no more than {max_length} messages), people have places to be and it is a time for celebration or disappointment. Also ensure the content generated is real dialogue/speech and not instructions like [Host concludes], [Ad break] or something similar. Finally, this is a college {sport} broadcast, it is supposed to be fun. When Host 1 signs off and ends the broadcast, you must include the phrase \\\"Thanks for listening folks!\\\" in the response. When going to an advertisement break, you must say somewhere in the response, the exact words \\\"hear from our sponsors\\\". Again, please keep it short, Host 1 should sign off after a few callers. If Host 1 sees a long list of messages, host 1 should close the broadcast in the way previously mentioned. Additionally, do not assume any other role other than what your prompt tells you you are. There should only be one sequence of sentences per prompt. There should be no directions like it is a script, because it is not. Things like \\\"(After advertisement)\\\" will not be tolerated.\"\n",
